# Easy Cluster Finder
~~A tool for generating a chunk loader for the falling block ["Easy Method"](https://hackmd.io/8CVUgBDTQl22LifmgFmotA).~~

Rehash method is obsolete. Synchronize method does not require cluster chunks, so this is being modified specifically for improving falling block swap chances.

I'd use Earth's program, but this already had the tree loading, which looks cool and doesn't require relogging to downsize the hashmap (hopefully).

The tool generates a png for visualization as well as a Litematica file
for building the chunkloader.
